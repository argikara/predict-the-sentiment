# predict-the-sentiment

The data I used was taken from the kaggle. I want to make a prediction about sentiment based on some tweets. Initially, the data is cleaned, then the stop words are removed and the pos tagging is done and finally the algorithms of random forest and naive bayes are used for prediction.
